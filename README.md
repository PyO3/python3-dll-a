Standalone `python3.dll` import library generator
=================================================

Generates import libraries for the Stable ABI Python DLL
for MinGW-w64 cross-compile targets.

See <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html> for details.

This crate **does not require** Python 3 distribution files
to be present on the cross-compile host system.
